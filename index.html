“Sometimes the best way to prepare for the future is to get stuck in past.”

Nostalgia /na’staldz(i)e/ noun :
A sentimental longing or wistful affection for a period in past.
Ex: “Shh … don’t tell anyone but I am feeling nostalgia of the last time I wrote essay, this time will try my best”
<br><br><br>
Nostalgia is often triggered by memories of past events, people, or places, and is often accompanied by feelings of warmth, happiness, and even sadness (Be aware it is all linked with how you see it).
<br><br><br>
The experience of nostalgia can be a powerful motivator, driving people to pursue goals or aspirations that are inspired by their fond memories of the past. At the same time, nostalgia can also be a destructor, causing people to become stuck in the past and preventing them from moving forward in their lives.
<br><br><br>
Let’s see the positive side, nostalgia can serve as a motivator by providing a sense of purpose and meaning in life. When we look back on our past experiences and remember the joy and fulfilment that they brought us, it can inspire us to seek out similar experiences in the present. For example, if someone has fond memories of playing a particular sport in their youth, they may be motivated to get back into the sport as a way of reliving those past experiences and recapturing that sense of purpose and joy(also I don’t know what’s the best way to relax after a tiring day other than playing sports!)
<br><br><br>
Nostalgia can also be a source of inspiration and creativity. When we reflect on our past experiences, we can often draw on those memories to inform our current actions and decisions. For example, someone who has fond memories of traveling might be inspired to plan a new trip or take up a new hobby related to travel. Similarly, someone who has fond memories of a particular career or occupation might be motivated to pursue a similar path in the present.

On the other hand, nostalgia can also be a destructor by causing you to become stuck in the past and preventing them from moving forward in their lives. When we focus too much on our past experiences and memories, we can lose sight of the present and the opportunities it offers. This can lead to feelings of regret and a sense of missed opportunities, which can be demoralizing and disheartening.
<br><br><br>
Furthermore, nostalgia can also be destructive when it leads people to compare their present circumstances to those of the past. This can create a sense of dissatisfaction and frustration, as people may feel that they are not living up to their own expectations or the expectations of others. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and a lack of motivation, as people may feel that they are not capable of achieving their goals or aspirations.
<br><br><br>
In conclusion, nostalgia is a double edged sword, it can be both a motivator and a destructor, depending on how it is experienced and managed. When used in a positive and healthy way, nostalgia can provide a sense of purpose and inspiration, and can motivate you to pursue your goals and aspirations. However, when it becomes all-consuming and prevents you from moving forward, then it can be destructive, leading to feelings of regret and missed opportunities. It is important to find a balance between remembering the past and living in the present, in order to achieve a sense of fulfilment and happiness in life.
